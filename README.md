This is a repo associated with the following Medium article:

It explores the problem "Convert the integer N to the decimal 0.N" in a hopefully humorous way.
We also explore the performance of several solutions and find some interesting results.



## Setup

You can run this code however you want.  I compiled it down to a jar file and set up a basic CLI.
Once it's a jar running
` java -jar speedtest.jar` will show the two commands useable and the arguments they take.

Otherwise its up to you to modify the code and test it how you please.
